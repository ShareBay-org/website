- Update logo

- For dev, install a cPanel and get site running (with MySQL) :
  - Maybe get Apache running locally (failed on Trent's Mac because "you may need to install the Image::Resize module" at "./common.pl line 1525" even though `cpan` installed it fine).
  - Maybe run a Docker container with Apache & Perl, even pointing at local files. See https://perlmaven.com/getting-started-with-perl-on-docker
  - Configure from source :
    - Change instructions to use config.pl $siteroot & $root
    - Move config.pl to a non-source-controlled location.
    - Script the dev-specific setup (maybe set up HonorPay DB)
